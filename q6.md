## 1. System Specification

- Lay down specifications of the system, considering performance, functionality, physical dimensions, fabrication technology, and design techniques.
- Specify size, speed, power, and functionality of the VLSI system.

## 2. Architectural Design

- Design basic architecture, including decisions such as RISC vs. CISC, number of ALUs, Floating Point units, pipelines, and cache size.
- Outcome: Micro-Architectural Specification (MAS).

## 3. Behavioral or Functional Design

- Identify main functional units and interconnect requirements.
- Estimate area, power, and other parameters for each unit.
- Specify behavior in terms of input, output, and timing without detailing internal structure.
- Outcome: Timing diagram or relationships between units.

## 4. Logic Design

- Derive control flow, word widths, register allocation, arithmetic operations, and logic operations.
- Express design in Register Transfer Level (RTL) using Hardware Description Language (HDL).
- Minimize Boolean expressions for smallest logic design.
- Simulate and test logic design for correctness.
- Outcome: RTL description.

## 5. Circuit Design

- Convert Boolean expressions into a circuit representation, considering speed and power requirements.
- Use circuit simulation to verify correctness and timing.
- Express circuit design in a detailed diagram (netlist).
- Schematic capture tools are used for manual entry.
- Netlist can be automatically generated from RTL description using logic synthesis tools.

## 6. Physical Design

- Convert netlist into a geometric representation (layout).
- Layout involves creating geometric shapes for logic components and connections in multiple layers.
- Follow design rules based on fabrication process limitations and electrical properties.
- Physical design is complex and may be automated or partially automated.
- Manual layout may offer better area and performance for larger designs.
- Outcome: Geometric representation of the circuit.

## 7. Fabrication

- Layout data is sent for fabrication on a tape, and the event is called Tape Out.
- Layout data is converted into photo-lithographic masks, one for each layer.
- Masks guide the deposition, diffusion, and removal of materials on the wafer.
- Wafers are grown, sliced, and polished.
- Fabrication process involves multiple steps with dozens of masks.
- Prototype is made and tested before mass production.

## 8. Packaging, Testing, and Debugging

- Wafer is diced into individual chips and packaged.
- Each chip is tested to ensure it meets design specifications and functions properly.
- Chips are packaged in various formats (DIP, PGA, BGA, QFP) or used in Multi-Chip Modules (MCMs).
- Final testing ensures quality and adherence to design requirements.
